# DAA-Combinational-Optimization
A unified Python framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems like TSP, Knapsack, and Graph Coloring using multiple strategies (greedy, DP, backtracking, branch-and-bound). It enables benchmarking to compare efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across algorithms.
